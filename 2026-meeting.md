## Goals of the Meeting

In discussions at the previous two Python in Chemistry Meetings, it has become clear that Python is being taught in different ways at different institutions. Partly this is a function of the mode and timing of delivery: whether it is delivered in core or optional modules; whether in a standalone module or as part of a broader skills module; to which year group(s); which applications are in focus. As a result of this variation in logistics, the goals, methods and structure of our Python teaching practice diverge. We aim to use this meeting to showcase some of these different approaches, and provide attendees an opportunity to dicuss with other educators how their teaching methods and materials could be adapted to suit the particular constraints and requirements of their institution.
