    "MatPlotLib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualisations. Within MatPlotLib, the module PyPlot provides a fairly intuitive way of plotting, and is able to open interactive figures on your screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two different ways of using the library: an explicit or \"Axes\" interface, and an implicit \"pyplot\" interface. The explicit interfaces defines each figure step by step and builds the visualisation step-by-step, with every step explicitly defined. The implicit method keeps track of the last Figure and Axes created and adds aditional content to the object it thinks the user wants. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are only plotting simple figures, the implicit method is sufficient, however if you wish to create multiple figures, you may run into problems trying to refer to the correct figure, and should use the explicit method. Be aware that many online examples will use the two methods interchangeably, and in some cases, at the same time. Have a look on the MatPlotLib website for more information on the [two interfaces](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/figure/api_interfaces.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "To use matplotlib.pyplot simply import it. It is usually imported using the alias `plt`. \n",
