    "The other issue where round off can occur is when a big and a small number are added together. Due to how the float is represented the effect of the small number might be lost as it can not be represented with in the precision. For example if the float has 8 digits of representation then if the magnitude of the difference between the numbers is greater than 8 orders it can not be included.\n",
