    "Python is extremely useful for numerical computing. There are seven principle mathematical operations that Python can do, the notation for which might be slightly different to what you're used to (e.g. &times; is written as ``*`` in Python). Further mathematical operations (such as logarithms, trigonometry, and calculus) are available through imported modules and libraries (such as [`math`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the principal mathematical operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation    | Mathematical Notation | Pythonic Notation |\n",
    "| -------- | ------- | ------- |\n",
    "| Addition  | $a + b$ | `a + b` |\n",
    "| Subtraction | $a - b$ | `a - b` |\n",
    "| Multiplication | $a \\times b$ | `a * b` |\n",
    "| Division | $a \\div b$ | `a / b` |\n",
    "| Exponent | $a ^ b$ | `a ** b` |\n",
    "| Modulo | $a \\textrm{ mod } b$ | `a % b` |\n",
    "| Floored Division | $a // b$ | `a // b` |\n",
    "\n",
    "The modulo and floored division operations may be new to you. \n",
    "- Modulo computes the remainder from the division of two numbers. For example, ``5 % 2`` returns ``1``, and ``19 % 4`` returns ``3``. \n",
    "- Floored division is the partner to modulo, and returns only the integer part of the division. For example. ``5 // 2`` returns ``2``, and ``19 // 4`` returns ``4``. \n",
    "- Other, more complicated operations are also available through Python libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, Python can only perform maths on variables of the data type ``integer`` or ``float``. Maths performed on strings or lists will result in strange outcomes (see below for some examples).\n",
    "\n",
    "A single line of code may have many mathematical operations. In this event, Python will follow the standard order of mathematical operations: you might know this as [BODMAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations#Mnemonics). Use round brackets \"()\" when coding your formulas to avoid ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maths can be done both with numbers and with variable, as long as the variable is of the correct type (integer or float). Storing numbers as variables becomes extremely useful when they are being used often, and when they are needed to a large number of significant figures. For example, instead of writing out &pi; or Avogadro's number each time it is used, you can store it at the beginning and only call it by the name you have given it.\n",
