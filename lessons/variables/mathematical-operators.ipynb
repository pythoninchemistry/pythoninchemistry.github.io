    "- `angle_A` is given in degrees, however the module `math` does trigonometry in radians. You can change degrees into radians using the `math` function `math.radians()`.\n",
    "- The maths operator for exponents is `**` not `^`.\n",
    "- In the sum, the 'c' in `side_C` is capitalised when it shouldn't be. Variables are case sensitive. Since `side_c` was defined the first time using a lowercase 'c', all following instances should also use a lowercase letter.\n",
    "- There is a missing multiplication symbol `*` between `side_b` and `side_c`.\n",
    "- 'Cos' is a function from the module 'math'. Therefore, to use it we should do `math.cos(angle_A)`, not just `cos(angle_A)`. The function also only takes angles in radians, so make sure your input here is in radians, not degrees!\n",
    "- The sum is missing a closing bracket. All opened brackets must be closed in Python.\n",
