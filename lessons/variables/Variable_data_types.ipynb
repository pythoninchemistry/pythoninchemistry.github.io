    "## Naming of variables\n",
    "\n",
    "There are few rules you must follow when naming a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable name requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Variables can only start with a letter or underscore (_) character and may not start with a number.\n",
    "*   Can only include upper and lowercase letters, numbers and the underscore character (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).\n",
    "*   Names must not be a [Python keyword](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords).\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to memorise all Python keywords. Any good code editor should highlight keywords in a different colour to your regular variables, thereby alerting you of potential conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Good variable naming\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right variable name will allow your code to be easier to understand for you and future programmers interacting with your code. Good names increase clarity, therefore they should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Descriptive\n",
    "The name gives a hint about what the value means.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Bad example   | Good example       |\n",
    "|---------------|--------------------|\n",
    "| `number = 12` | `atomic_mass = 12` |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Short\n",
    "The name is brief without compromising clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Bad example                                | Good example          |\n",
    "|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n",
    "| `molecular_mass_of_protium_oxide = 18.015` | `water_mass = 18.015` |\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if your programme distinguishes between different kinds of masses or between light and heavy water, the former choice could be the correct one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Consistent\n",
    "The name follows a convention to avoid multiple spellings of one same thing. The preferred convention for variable names in Python is called `snake_case`, where all letters are lower-case and words can be separated by underscore characters (`_`).\n",
    "\n",
    "| Bad example                | Good example                |\n",
    "|----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n",
    "| `roomTemperature = 298.15` | `room_temperature = 298.15` |\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, descriptiveness, shortness, and consistency come into conflict, and it is up to you to decide which one should win out for the best clarity. As an exercise, think of a good variable name for the molecular mass of the last molecule you synthesised. For example:"
