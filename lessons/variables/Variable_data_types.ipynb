    "## Naming of variables\n",
    "\n",
    "There are few strict conventions with the naming of variables, and Python can be incredibly tolerant in this regard. However, for the ease of legibility of code, and minimise mistakes caused by referring to the wrong variable, it is sensible to try and use a clear and consistent approach to variable naming.\n",

    "### Variable name requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Variables can only start with a letter or underscore (_) character and may not start with a number.\n",
    "*   Can only include upper and lowercase letters, numbers and the underscore character (A-z, 0-9, and _ )\n",
    "*   Names must not be a [Python keyword](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing variable names\n",
    "Short, descriptive names are generally a good choice, as variables will often need to be entered in multiple places in code. Names can consist of multiple words, but cannot use spaces. Commonly 'camelCase' is used with variable naming, where a multiple word variable name is closed together (ie the spaces are removed), and the initial letter of each word being capitalised (excluding the first word).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples might include:\n",
