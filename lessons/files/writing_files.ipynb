    "We have seen how Python can process chemical data and perform calculations. Once you have run your program, it is likely that you want to save your data to a file to use for later. This is called 'writing'. To write to a file, you change the mode from ``\"r\"`` to one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``\"w\"`` is write mode. If the file doesn't already exist, it is created. If the file already exists, any data already in it is removed, and data is added as if it was an empty file.\n",
    "- ``\"a\"`` is append mode open for writing. If the file doesn't already exist, it is created. Any data written to the file appears at the bottom of any data already in the file.\n",
    "- Adding ``+`` to the end of the letter means the file is also opened for reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function ``.write()`` allows any content within the brackets to be written to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "file = open(\"new_file.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "file.write(\"content\" + str(variable_name) + \"content\")\n",
    "file.write(f\"content {variable_name} \\n content\")\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note:\n",
    "- Since the file \"new_file.txt\" does not already exist, the first line creates a file with this name.\n",
    "    - If the file already existed, this first line would wipe the data of that file ready to write over with the next lines. You need to be careful that you don't do this to files you want to keep!\n",
    "- The function ``.write()`` allows content within the brackets to be written to the file.\n",
    "    - You can write using <b>concatenation</b> (as in line 2). Here, strings are combined into one long string using the '+' symbol. \n",
    "    - You can write using f-strings, as we have seen in the past. \n",
    "    - Putting two ``file.write()`` statements does not place your items on a new line. You need to add the special characer ``\"\\n\"`` to write a new line. Other special characters you might use are ``\"\\n\"``, the carriage return (moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line), and ``\"\\t\"``, which inserts a tab.\n",
    "- You can iterate using 'for' to print a phrase over and over again.\n",
    "- Once you are done, you close the file. Just like with reading, this is good practice."
