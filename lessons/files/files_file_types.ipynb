For example, you may have a directory called 'Lab Documents', which might contain a subdirectory 'Module A Practical B', in which you hold all your results, risk assessments, and writeups for Practical B of Module A. The directory 'Lab Documents', is itself a subdirectory of something else, stemming back until you reach the root directory, often called ``C:\\`` on a Windows operating system, or ``/var/root/`` on a Apple mac.
