    "Directories branch downwards from the root directory, and can contain both files and subdirectories. For example, you may have a directory called 'Lab Documents', which might contain a subdirectory 'Module A Practical B', in which you hold all your results, risk assessments, and writeups for Practical B of Module A. The directory 'Lab Documents', is itself a subdirectory of something else, stemming back until you reach the root directory, often called ``C:\\`` on a Windows operating system, or ``/var/root/`` on a Apple mac. This way, we can cluster together groups of related files to keep ourselves better organised. \n",

If I was looking at my lab notes, I might be in the directory: ``C:\\Users\\Bella\\Documents\\University\\Lab Documents\\Module A\\Practical B``. The directory list can get very long very fast, so naming your files and directories accurately and consistently is recommended. Also try not to have too many unnecessary additional mostly-empty directories. "
