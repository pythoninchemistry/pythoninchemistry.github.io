    "- **Colours**. The majority of Python IDEs automatically highlight different kinds of Python objects for readability. Keywords, words that cannot be used as variable names (such as True, False, import, not, etc.), are highlighted in certain colours, while variable names and variable types are highlighted differently, and so on. This helps easily identify spelling errors and signpost what the code does. The specific colours depends on the IDE you use. Some of the different highlighting is shown below (in no usable order). Throughout the lessons you will learn what each word written below means and how they can be used.\n",

    "- Python is **case sensitive**, with the default being lowercase. Built-in Python functions are given in lowercase. For example, writing `PRINT(\"hello\")` instead of `print(\"hello\")` would return an error, as the function `print()` is case-sensitive, and must be given in lowercase.\n",

    "- Python uses **new lines** to complete a command. Two print statements on two separate lines will execute one after another. \n",
    "- **Indented text** is an important distinction. When we move onto conditional statements and loops, the indentation defines which code belongs to which statement or loop. Therefore it is important to ensure your text is left-aligned. If you indent where Python is not expecting it, or do not indent where Python is expecting it, you will get an error message. The standard indentation is achieved using the `<tab>` key, equivalent to four spaces.\n",
