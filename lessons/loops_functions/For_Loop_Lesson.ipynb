    "- The syntax of a ``for`` loop is: ``for i in list:``, and the code within the loop is on the lines immediately following it, indented using ``<tab>``\n",
    "- If retrieving a value in a nested list, you can use ``i[0]`` to retrieve the first item, ``i[1]`` to retrieve the second item, and so on. It is not recommended to use Python lists for anything higher than a 2-dimensional list, as it gets confusing very quickly. Instead, you might want to consider [NumPy](../common_libs/Introduction_to_NumPy.ipynb) arrays (covered in a further lesson).\n",
    "- When iterating through two related lists of the same size, you can associate them pairwise using the ``zip()`` function. The syntax is: ``for i, j in zip(list1, list2):``. The two lists MUST be the same dimensions.\n",
    "- You can assign each item in a list an index value using the ``enumerate()`` function. The syntax is: ``for index, value in enumerate(list):``.\n",
    "- Use the ``range()`` function to iterate a set number of times. The syntax is: ``for i in range(2,8,1))``, where '2' is the start number, '8' is the end number (which, if printed, would be '7' because of Python's zero-indexing), and '1' is the increase step (which can be negative if you are counting down). If you only put a single number into the ``range()`` function, it will count from 0 up to but not including the number you have put in. \n",
    "- The built-in function ``len()`` will find the length of a list.\n",
    "- Loops inside of loops can compare every combination, iterate multiple actions on each element in a list, and more.\n",
