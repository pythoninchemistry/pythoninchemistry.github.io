    "How are these comparisons useful for working with actual chemical data though? Writing a comparison for every data point would get very tiring! This is where conditional statements come in -- we can use the comparisons we have learned about to check **if** certain relationships are true as part of our data sets, and then either do something or not, or even doing a different operation...\n",

    "When the statement after ```if``` is True, then Python will go on to do whatever is **indented**. Indentation is the way for python to know what is part of the ```if``` statement and what is the rest of the code. As a standard, indenting is 4 spaces before the code line -- many programs like jupyter notebook will automatically do this indenting after the if statement is written and you move to a new line with the Return key.\n",
    "\n",
    "If what comes after the ```if``` is False, then the indented code is ignored, and Python continues onto whatever the next non-indented lines are. As with loops, there must be a colon after the if statement, and there must be an indentation -- not having these can cause errors."
