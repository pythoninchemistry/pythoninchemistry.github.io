    "We have already seen a number of functions in Python, although you might not have realised that that's what they were. For example, the built-in functions, ``print()``, ``range()``, ``type()``, ``len()``, as well as some those from the module ``math``, including ``math.cos()`` and ``math.log10()``. Each of these functions do a specific task which would take a long time to write out by hand in your program. Each function takes one or multiple inputs (known as **arguments**), which you place inside the brackets (like ``print(\"hello\")``, where in this case the string ``\"hello\"`` is the argument, and word 'hello' is returned on your console). You don't need to write a script explaining to the computer how to translate the input and put it onto your screen, because it is already linked to the word ``print()``, which runs all that code automatically once typed. \n",

Only peaks with a wavenumber above 1500 cm<sup>-1</sup> and with a transmittance less than 95% can be analysed by the students. Write a function that can take the two lists below and output only the useful values.
