    "We have already seen a number of functions in Python, although you might not have realised that that's what they were. For example the built-in functions, ``print()``, ``range()``, ``type()``, ``len()``, as well as some those from other modules like ``math``, including ``math.cos()`` and ``math.log10()``. Each of these functions do a specific task which would take a long time to write out by hand in your program. Each function takes one or multiple inputs, which you place inside the brackets (like ``print(\"hello\")``, where in this case the string ``\"hello\"`` is the input, and the output would be the word 'hello'). You don't need to write a script explaining to the computer how to translate the input and put it onto your screen, because it is already linked to the word ``print()``, which runs all that code automatically once typed. \n",

The script iterates through the list, and adds each element in it to a running total variable, which at the end of the function contains the total:"
