    "The RDKit Python library makes drawing molecules simple. It requires two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Create a molecule object that RDKit can operate on\n",
    "2.   Use the Draw function in RDKit's chemistry module to create the 2D image corresponding to the molecule object\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, we must first tell Python to import the requires functionality from the RDKit package. Then, we are free to build our molecule and plot it.\n",
