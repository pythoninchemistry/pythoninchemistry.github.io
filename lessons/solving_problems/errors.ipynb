    "Perhaps the most common errors, where the user mistypes the code they are writing. Can be subtle, remember that Python is case-sensitive. So it is easy to type the wrong variable name with different capitalisation. To minimise typos, try autocompleting your words using the `<Tab>` key.\n",

Perhaps most important is which line is in error (indicated by the `---->`) allowing you to at least track it down. If there is ever more than one error it is usually best to start with the first error, often correcting this corrects the others. The error in the code above is that the code is attempting to add a string (`'str'`) to an integer (`'int'`) using the `+` command (the operand). This is not allowed for `+`.\n",
