    "PEP stands for 'Python Enhancement Proposal', and presents some of the key points you can use to make your code more organized and readable. Within PEP, [PEP8 is the style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), and lists the conventions for ensuring Python code looks good, focussing on readability, simplicity, adaptability, and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability is one of the key aspects of PEP8. Programming code is always read more than it is written. Whether this is you going back to check and edit your work, a colleague working on the same piece of code as you, or your lecturer marking your work, it will be read many more times than written down. This is why making your code look good and readable is very important. It also needs to be adaptable for different purposes. \n",

    "\n",
    "For these reasons, it is highly recommended that you follow the PEP8 style guide as closely as possible. However, this is not always possible. PEP8 quotes the essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson: \"A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds\". In other words: Following the style guide is important, but you need to know when to be inconsistent and break the style guide - sometimes the style guide doesn't apply, and you need to use your best judgement in those cases. If applying the style guide makes your code less readable, you should break it. "
